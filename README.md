# The xcolor-material package
The `xcolor-material` package is built on top of the great [xcolor](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/xcolor) package. It provides a useful definition of the beautiful **Google Material Color Palette**, available at https://material.google.com/style/color.html, for its use in document writing with LaTeX and Friends.

## Installation
Once the `xcolor-material` package is released in [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/), users should be able to install it from the TeX distribution package manager available in their PC. However, if you need to install this package manually, you should run:

```
latex xcolor-material.ins
```

and copy the generated file `xcolor-material.sty` to a path where LaTeX can find it. To generate the documentation run the following command twice.

```
pdflatex xcolor-material.dtx
```
